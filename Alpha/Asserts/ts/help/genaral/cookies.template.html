    <p>Effective Date: February 2, 2015</p>
    <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across websites, including on ASKfm. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to ASKfm, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.</p>
    <p>ASKfm uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to our site. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using our services. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into ASKfm. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.</p>
    <p><strong>Why does ASKfm use cookies and similar technologies?</strong></p>
    <p>ASKfm uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags, to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways.</p>
    <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
    <p><strong>1. Authentication and security:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To log you into ASKfm;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>To protect your security; and</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate ASKfm’s <a href="/legal/en/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to ASKfm and prevent unauthorised parties from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate content through our services.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Preferences:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences; and</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>To remember your settings and other choices you have made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with ASKfm content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit ASKfm.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Analytics and research:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>To help us improve and understand how people use our services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimise and improve your experience on ASKfm by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.</p>
    <p>To help us better understand how people use our services, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics, Quantcast and Scorecard.
