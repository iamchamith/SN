    <p>Effective Date: March 8, 2017</p>
    <p>These Terms of Use (the “TOU”), govern your access to and use of the website and/or mobile application that link to these TOU (the “Services”) that are operated by Ask.fm Europe Limited (“ASKfm,” “we”, “our”, or “us”) and you agree to only access or use the Services in compliance with the TOU.</p>
    <p>If there’s anything you don’t understand in the TOU (or anywhere else on the Services), please contact us using the contact information below.</p>
    <p>If you are under the age of majority in your country, and are not an emancipated minor (in countries that permit this) you must have your parent’s or guardian’s consent to enter into these TOU and to use the Services and by using of the Services you acknowledge that you have received such consent.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Your Acceptance of the TOU</strong></p>
    <p>By accessing or using the Services (whether or not you are a registered member), you, your heirs, and assigns (collectively, “you”) are entering into a binding legal agreement with Ask.fm Europe, Ltd., an Irish company with registration number 551873 and its registered office is at 6th Floor, South Bank House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Ireland is a member of the European Union, so the ASKfm is subject to Irish and EU law.</p>
    <p>By accessing, using, registering for or receiving any of the Services, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of these TOU and to the ASKfm <a href="/legal/en/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/legal/en/cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>, which are incorporated herein by reference. <b>If you do not accept and agree to the TOU then you must not access or use the Services.</b></p>
    <p><strong>2. Eligibility and Registration</strong></p>
    <p>a) <b>Age Requirements</b>. By accessing or using the Services, you affirm that you are either over the age of majority in your country, an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions in the TOU. In any case, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to access or use the Services. If we become aware that you are using the Services even though you are under 13 and not permitted to do so, we will deactivate your account and attempt to block you from accessing the Services.</p>
    <p>b) <b>Compliance with Laws</b>. You are responsible for making sure you follow all laws and regulations in the country in which you live when you access and use the Services. By using the Services, you are confirming that you have not been convicted of, nor are you subject to any court order relating to, assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.</p>
    <p>c) To use some parts of the Services, you may be required to register for an account with ASKfm by providing certain information, including your name, email address, and a password. You agree to provide true and accurate information and to update it as necessary to keep it accurate. If you provide us with false information, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account. You may also be able to register to use the Services by logging into your account with your credentials from certain third party social networking sites (e.g., Facebook). You confirm that you are the owner of this social media account and that you are entitled to disclose your social media login information to us. You authorize us to collect your authentication information, and other information that may be available on or through your social media account consistent with your applicable settings and instructions.</p>
    <p>d) <b>Unregistered Users</b>. In some countries we permit the asking of questions by unregistered users. In order to do this you must accept our terms of use and privacy policy. These terms and our privacy policy therefore should be adhered to by you whether you are a registered or unregistered user. For full information on unregistered users, what data we collect about them, and how you can choose to receive questions from them, or not, please see Section 3A of our <a href="/legal/en/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.  If you are asking a question as an unregistered user you must continue to follow the rules of conduct of the site and app or you will be banned at our discretion for abuse of this feature at any time and for any reason if we suspect or believe you are breaching our rules, these terms, any of our policies, or have been reported by another user for improper or concerning behavior.</p>
    <p>Only you are allowed to access your account. You must keep your password confidential and, other than sharing it with your parent or guardian if you are a minor, you should not tell anyone your password or let anyone else access your account. (Parents and guardians might also find some useful information <a href="http://support.ask.fm/?lang=en">here</a>). Sharing your password might lead to all of your posts, messages and personal information being leaked or someone impersonating or pretending to be you. If you don’t keep your password confidential or give it to anyone other than your parent or guardian, we are not responsible for anyone accessing or using your account, including reading or sending messages from it. If you think that someone else might be using your account, you must let us know immediately using the contact information below. You should also immediately change your password. We may terminate your account or block you from accessing the Services if you break the rules on keeping your password secure.</p>
    <p>To provide you with ease of access to your account, we may implement technology that enables us to recognize your device and provides you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype your password when you revisit the Services.</p>
    <p>Non-registered users are able to access only the parts of the Services that are publicly available and do not enjoy all of the privileges of being a registered member. They are, however, subject to the TOU.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Rules of Conduct</strong></p>

    <p>a) The Services are proprietary and are protected by copyright laws, international treaty provisions, trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property laws and treaties.

You agree to abide by all applicable copyright and other laws, as well as any additional copyright notices or restrictions contained in the Services. You acknowledge that the Services contain original works and have been developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by ASKfm and others through the application of methods and standards of judgment developed and applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and money and constitutes valuable intellectual property of ASKfm and such others.

Other than as provided in the TOU, in particular this Section 6, your use of the Trademarks, or any other ASKfm content is strictly prohibited. You are also advised that ASKfm will enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
    <p>c)&nbsp;<b>Copyright Claims.</b>&nbsp;ASKfm is committed to protecting the intellectual property of others, and we ask the same of our users. Below, ASKfm provides rights holders with information regarding how to report copyright and other intellectual property infringements by people posting content on ASKfm. It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright or other IP rights infringement, and in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ASKfm and/or others.</p>
    <p>d) <b>Notice for Claims of Intellectual Property Violations and Agent for Notice.</b></p>
    <p>This process is for copyright and intellectual property matters only and is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to ASKfm as straightforward as possible while also providing ASKfm with the necessary information for notice verification.</p>
    <p>If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide ASKfm’s Copyright Agent with a written communication containing the following information in English (your "Notice"):</p>
    <p><i>Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, you should specify the intellectual property right at issue.</i></p>
    <p>1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
    <p>2. A detailed description sufficient to identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works have been infringed, a representative list of such works on the ASKfm site;</p>
    <p>3. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate this material on the ASKfm site (as part of this information, you must provide us with the specific URL where the material is located);</p>
    <p>4. Information sufficient for ASKfm to contact you, including your username (if applicable), address, telephone number, and/or email address;</p>
    <p>5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agents, or the law;</p>
    <p>6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury (if you are located in the US) or made truthfully (if you are located elsewhere) that the information in this notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner for the material or that you are authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content to which ASKfm has disabled access (or intends to disable access), ASKfm may forward a copy of your notification including your name and contact information to the subscriber or account holder. The individual may choose to file a counter-notification explaining why the content does not infringe an IP right following receipt of our notice. We may also, in our sole discretion, post a notice or a copy of your complaint on our site. By providing us with a complaint, you are consenting to your complaint being forwarded to the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content, and/or to our posting a notice or copy of your complaint on our site.</p>
    <p>After submitting a copyright, or other IP right, infringement notification, you may realize that you misidentified content or you might otherwise change your mind. ASKfm will honor retractions of copyright or other IP claims from the party who originally submitted them.</p>
    <p>It is important that you do not make false claims. Submitting a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences. Before you report a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement to us, you may wish to reach out to the individual posting the content. You may be able to resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention without contacting us at all.</p>
    <p>If you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance. Keep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or similar laws in other countries.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of the DMCA, ASKfm’s Agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>11. Termination</strong></p>
    <p>(a) <b>Deactivation or Termination by you.</b> If you are a registered user of the Services, you can deactivate your membership at any time by going to the Settings control when you are logged in and choosing the “deactivate profile” link. By deactivating your account, it will no longer be visible to other users of the Services but we will save your profile information in case you change your mind later and want to re-activate your account. Many members deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to the Services. You should therefore be able to restore your account and the whole of your profile within 12 months of deactivating it but we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case. Should you choose to leave the Services, rather than deactivate your account, you may do so by selecting the “I want to leave ASKfm” tab on the <a href="http://support.ask.fm" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> page. Once received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable. Once processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services and your questions to friends will be converted to anonymous questions (in other words, questions you have asked will remain visible but will appear to be from an anonymous user). You will be able to reactivate your account by logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave the Services is processed. At the end of that period your account will be deleted and all “likes” which you have added to questions will be removed. We will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in certain cases limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully deleted.</p>
    <p><b>Warning:&nbsp; After you have deactivated your account or left the Services, questions may still appear on the Services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend’s profile will still be visible, but will not include your user name).&nbsp; Please note also that even after you remove information from your profile or deactivate your account, copies of such content may still be visible and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or to the extent such information has been shared with, indexed by or cached by search engines.&nbsp; Similarly, if you have given third party applications or websites (e.g., social networks) access to your personal information they may keep that information.&nbsp; We cannot control this, nor do we accept any responsibility or liability for this.</b></p>
    <p>(b) <b>Suspension or Termination by Us.</b> We may suspend or terminate a user's access to the Services or a member’s account for any reason, including if we believe a user has violated these TOU. We also reserve the right to at any time block users from accessing and using the Services, by using IP blockers or other technological solutions we deem appropriate. If we have grounds to terminate your access to the Services due to a violation of these TOU (including your breach of the Rules of Conduct), we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services without notice. Otherwise, we will provide you with reasonable notice if your access to the Services and/or your profile is going to be suspended or terminated.</p>
    <p>(c) <b>Effect of Termination.</b> Upon termination or expiration of your rights to use the Services or any portion thereof, you authorize us to delete any files, programs, data and messages associated with your account for the Services, or applicable portion thereof, without notice to you.</p>
    <p><strong>12. General</strong></p>
    <p>a) <b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</b> You agree that: (i) the Services shall be provided from Ireland;  (ii) the laws of Ireland apply to these TOU, including any contractual or non-contractual matter or dispute arising out of or in connection with these TOU, your access to and use of the Services, and the relationship between us and you; and (iii) the courts of Ireland have exclusive jurisdiction in connection with these TOU and all such matters and disputes arising out of or connected to the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may seek interim, preliminary or protective relief before the competent courts of any jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>b) <b>Data Charges.</b> By using the Services, including certain features such as invite-a-friend, on your mobile phone (and/or any other device) you may be subject to charges by your Internet or mobile service provider, so check with them first if you are not sure, as you will be responsible for any such costs.</p>
    <p>c) <b>Entire Agreement and Waiver.</b> These TOU, together with the <a href="/legal/en/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/legal/en/cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the Services. If, for any reason, any provision of these TOU is declared to be illegal, invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable by a competent court of any jurisdiction, then to the extent that term is illegal, invalid, void or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from these TOU and the remainder of these TOU shall survive, remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable. No failure or delay by us in exercising any right, power or privilege under these TOU shall operate as a waiver of such right or acceptance of any variation of these TOU and nor shall any single or partial exercise by either party of any right, power or privilege preclude any further exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.</p>
    <p>d) <b>No Third Party Rights.</b> Nothing in these TOU shall confer or purport to confer any rights on any other third party.</p>
    <p>e) <b>Restrictions on Assignment.</b> You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these TOU to anyone else without our written consent. All of our rights and obligations under the TOU are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, consolidation, reorganization, sale of assets, by operation of law or otherwise.</p>
    <p>f) <b>Linking and Framing.</b> You may not frame the Services.&nbsp; You may link to the Services, provided that you acknowledge and agree that you will not link the Services to any website containing any inappropriate, profane, defamatory, infringing, obscene, indecent, or unlawful topic, name, material, or information or that violates any intellectual property, proprietary, privacy, or publicity rights. Any violation of this provision may, in our sole discretion, result in termination of your use of and access to the Services effective immediately.</p>
